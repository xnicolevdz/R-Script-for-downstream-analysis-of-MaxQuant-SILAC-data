Depending on the version of MaxQuant used, you may need to manually adjust the column names from 'Ratio H/L normalized ...' columns. 
Newer versions might typically label these columns as 'Ratio H/L normalized 1', 'Ratio H/L normalized 2', etc., while older versions may use labels like 'Ratio H/L normalized 1F', 'Ratio H/L normalized 1R', etc. The current script assumes the latter naming convention.
